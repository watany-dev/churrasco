# Churrasco Break

Churrasco Break is a VS Code extension that delivers a different cut of churrasco to your editor every 10 minutes. It is not a strict Pomodoro timer — it is a light rhythm and a bit of play that does not break your flow.

When a meat arrives you can **Eat**, **Pass**, or **End for the day**. Every meat you eat is recorded in today's log, and your satiety, meat collection, and titles grow over time.

## Status

Active v0.1 development. The full v0.1 scope is tracked across [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) milestones M0–M7. Currently shipped: session service with a non-repeating meat draw, status bar countdown, Quick Pick menu, and arrival notifications wired to Eat / Pass / End-for-the-day handlers (M0–M4). The `cooled` flow auto-records meats that go untouched before the next arrival. Persistence (today's log, satiety, lifetime collection) and the simple sidebar land in M5–M6.

## Features (v0.1 target)

- A new meat arrives every 10 minutes.
- Non-repeating draw until the deck cycles.
- Status bar countdown to the next meat.
- Meat-arrival notification with **Eat / Pass / End for the day**.
- Today's meat log.
- Satiety tracker.
- Meat collection (lifetime totals).

## Development

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 24 or newer (pinned via `.nvmrc` and `engines.node`)
- pnpm 10.x (pinned via `packageManager`, activate with Corepack)
- VS Code 1.90 or newer (for the integration tests)

Common scripts:

```bash
pnpm install            # install dependencies (CI uses --frozen-lockfile)
pnpm compile            # type-check, emit @vscode/test-cli artifacts, esbuild bundle
pnpm watch              # tsc --noEmit and esbuild --watch in parallel
pnpm lint               # Biome check (lint + format + import sort)
pnpm lint:fix           # Biome auto-fix
pnpm format             # Biome format --write
pnpm knip               # detect unused files / exports / dependencies
pnpm test:unit          # Vitest unit tests with coverage
pnpm test:vscode        # @vscode/test-cli integration tests in an Extension Host
pnpm test               # test:unit + test:vscode
pnpm package            # build a .vsix with @vscode/vsce
pnpm ci                 # local CI: biome ci, check-types, knip, vitest --coverage, audit
```

Each task must finish with `pnpm ci` green before committing. The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same checks plus `pnpm test:vscode` and `pnpm package`.

Press F5 in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host with the bundled extension loaded.
